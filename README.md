# `cargox`

[![CI](https://github.com/mxcl/cargox/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mxcl/cargox/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/cargox-cli.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/cargox-cli)

`cargox` runs Rust binaries on demand, installing them automatically if necessary.
It mirrors the convenience of `npx` for the Cargo ecosystem while prioritising
`cargo-binstall` to download prebuilt executables whenever possible.

## Installation

We recommend installing cargo-binstall as well, this significantly speeds up
use of `cargox`:

```sh
cargo install cargo-binstall
cargo binstall cargox-cli
```

If you don’t want that then you can just `cargo install cargox-cli`.

## Features

- Executes `crate[@version]` binaries, installing them on demand.
- Prefers `cargo-binstall` for fast installs falling back to `cargo install`.
- Passes through additional arguments to the invoked binary via `--`.

## Usage

```bash
cargox <crate[@version]> [--] [binary-args...]
```

Examples:

```bash
# Run the latest bat that is installed or installing the latest bat if necessary
$ cargox bat ./README.md

$ cargox bat@latest ./README.md
# If the installed bat is old we only check for newer if you do this.
# This is how every foo*x* tool works. We are not being different.

# Install and run a pinned version
$ cargox cargo-deny@0.16.3 check

# Force a reinstall, building from source instead of using cargo-binstall
$ cargox --force --build-from-source cargo-nextest
# ^^ shorter: cargox -fs cargo-nextest
```

> [!TIP]
>
> - Arguments before the first positional are passed to `cargox`.
> - Arguments after the positional argument are passed to the invoked binary.
> - You can use `--` if necessary to define this separation point.

### Flags

- `--bin <name>`: choose a specific binary when a crate exposes several.
- `-f`, `--force`: reinstall even if the binary already exists on `PATH`.
- `-q`, `--quiet`: suppress installer output (still prints a short status line).
- `-s`, `--build-from-source`: build from source using `cargo install` instead of `cargo-binstall`.

## Versioned Installs

Every binary installed by `cargox` is stored with an explicit version suffix. For example, running `cargox bat@0.24.0` produces `bin/bat-0.24.0` under the install root. When you invoke `cargox bat` without a version, the newest installed version is selected automatically. The special specifier `@latest` triggers a crates.io lookup to install and run the newest published release if a newer one exists.

## Where Binaries Are Stored

`cargox` operates in a **completely sandboxed environment**, isolated from your
system's Cargo installation. This ensures that binaries installed by `cargox` are
separate and don't interfere with your regular `cargo install` workflow.

**Default install locations:**

- **Linux/Unix**: `~/.local/share/cargox/bin` (XDG Data Directory)
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/cargox/bin`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\cargox\bin`

**Customizing the install directory:**

You can override the default by setting:

- `CARGOX_INSTALL_DIR`: Custom location for `cargox` installations

**Complete sandboxing:**

`cargox` ensures complete isolation by:

1. **Not checking standard Cargo directories**: Binaries in `~/.cargo/bin`,
   `~/.local/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, or `CARGO_HOME/bin` are ignored when looking
   for already-installed binaries.

2. **Binary lookup is restricted to**:
   - The `cargox` install directory only

3. **Environment isolation**: When installing packages, `cargox` removes all
   Cargo-related environment variables (like `CARGO_INSTALL_ROOT`, `CARGO_HOME`,
   `BINSTALL_INSTALL_PATH`, etc.) to prevent any leakage into the installation
   process. Only the controlled `cargox` install directory is set.

This sandboxing guarantees that:

- You can test different versions without affecting your system installations
- `cargox` binaries won't accidentally shadow your regular Cargo binaries
- The installation process is predictable and reproducible

**Build artifact cleanup:**

`cargox` automatically cleans up build artifacts after installation:

- When using `cargo-binstall`, binaries are downloaded pre-built (no artifacts to clean)
- When using `cargo install`, build artifacts are placed in a temporary directory
  that is automatically cleaned up after installation completes

This keeps your system clean and prevents build cache bloat.
